- The 18/19 La Liga Spanish League.

## Milestones

We are huge soccer fans, so to able to learn how to manipulate data and datasets about soccer is really cool. We hope to gain valubale knowledge on all the types of stats in soccer and be able to see all the techinal stuff behind the scenes and how all these small but important stats (free kicks, home/away goals), impact a teams performance and their success in the season. We are interested in this because we are huge soccer fans so it and we want to know how each team gears up for success, and how every stat impacts how well they do in the season. As mentioned before, we want to know specficially how a teams performance is impacted by the specfic stats. For example, their home performance vs away performance, how many total goals they scored, etc. Building a dashboard would be really good for this dataset as we could show stuff like who scored the most goals in the season, which team had the most bets or money on them, best home/away team, and countless other things, so making a dashboard on this dataset would be awesome.
